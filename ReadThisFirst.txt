The main project here is AI News.  It has
things for AI in general, like in the
CsNeural repository, and it is being used
to experiment with news articles and AI.

The project file, AINews.csproj, in the
AINews repo, shows what files are used in
the project, and where they are.  For example
in the ItemGroup that shows:
Compile Include="\Eric\Main\CsNeural\NeuralNet.cs"
it shows the path to that file used in the
project.

Some repositories have their own
ReadThisFirst.txt file that is specific to
the source code in that repository.

A book that has some very good explanations of
Neural Networks and backpropagation is:
Deep Learning (The MIT Press Essential
Knowledge series)
by John D. Kelleher

Also, this is a good tutorial:

Matrix notation:
w for weight
w<sup>L<sub>jk
The weight for the connection
from the kth neuron in the (L - 1)th
layer to the jth neuron in the Lth
layer.

a for activation
a<sup>L<sub>j
Activation for the jth neuron in
the Lth layer.
